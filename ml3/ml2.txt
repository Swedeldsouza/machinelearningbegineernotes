Multicollinearity x and y as same age and salary (Variable)

no autocorrelation( error)
homoscedasticity
y=beta0+betax+error
 =beta0+beta1x1+beta2x2+betax3
change is x1 and x2 will change beta

so taking 1 variable aor 2 variable may not chnage value of y but change value of beta
(interaction)
one unit change in x is many unit change in y


autocorrelation-error,time series data
time dependent
scoring
random state is 0

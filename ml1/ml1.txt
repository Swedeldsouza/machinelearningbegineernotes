assumption of linear equations

 iid-independently indentical distribution
x and y are linearly related
error should be normally distributed

model:
train data set    5%
test data set /validation   4%
out of time validation   6%

scikit.org

Selection criteria:
classification and regression capabilities
it predicts continuous variiable ,like sales made during day,predict temp,poses a real challenge to fit data set on a straight line
change model

data quality:outliers can sistrupt the model

computationally complexity:
comprehsensible and transpa


*evaluating trends and sales estimation
mothly sales on y ,time on x axis

*analyze the impact of price changes
sold dependent variable and price as independent variable

*analyze risk  plotting claims vs customer age
